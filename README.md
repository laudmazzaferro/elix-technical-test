##ELIX technical test

Laura's technicial test for ELIX. Application to display a list of asstes and entities.It was done with react components.

###Description:

Using React.js and Node.js, you are asked to create an application to display in a grid view (portal) the assets and its related entities. Also, for the entities, you are asked to create a pop-up context menu (rightclick).

###Details:
· The application must have 2 pages/routes. The landing page displaying the assets, and the entities
page.
· The grid view must be a component and the use of external grid/portal frameworks is not allowed; we want to see how you create/structure components.
· Each portal must have a header row with the keys of the assets/entities.
· To navigate from the assets to the entities add a button to each row of data of the entities grid.
· The pop-up context menu must have only 1 option-choice, named test, which will print the id of the “right-clicked” entity into the console log.
· Use git repository to track the evolution of the project.


###Extra Info:
· We will evaluate the functionality and aesthetic of the app and if the code is well-structured and
commented.
· There is no authentication/user control needed.
· Any extra development and personal ideas for the project will be well received.
· The data provided was generated automatically. Do not worry if does not make any sense


###Endpoints

Assets: https://6y458uslg3.execute-api.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/elixos/assets

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
